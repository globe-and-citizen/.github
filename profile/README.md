# Welcome to Globe & Citizen

We are a fully remote company based out of Canada with members spread around the world.

Forget borders, feel free and feel safe to contribute because here at G&C, we pretend **Our World is One Country**. Disagree? Wherever you are, fork our repo and send us a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kBpdUbkNQU) and we'll hit you back with some cryptocurrency. There are no borders here!

## Development Roadmap

### Step 1: Develop a custom application to replace the WordPress blog.
Currently, Celebrity Fanalyzer is a very simple concept built on a very simple platform: WordPress. To gain more control over development, style, and function, a custom application is under development to replace the current version.

### Step 2: Convert the new application to a DAPP by linking competition reward to an ethereum smart contract.
Celebrity Fanalyzer is one of many projects exploring how blockchain technology can be used. Our goal is to connect Celebrity Fanalyzer to Ethereum thereby making it a DAPP (a **D**istributed **APP**lication). Anyone with a crypto wallet (we suggest Metamask) should be able to participate.

### Step 3: Finish development of Layer8, an "Anonymizing HTTP Reverse Proxy."
Currently, users of a most websites deposit easily trackable information every time they visit. Celebrity Fanalyzer is one of a few websites that DOESN‚ÄôT want your personal information. In fact, we want to avoid collecting it. For this reason, we are developing a unique solution that acts like a default VPN (Virtual Private Network) that runs in/through the browser. As such, anyone who visits a Layer8 website can benefit from anonymity without needing to sign up or configure their own VPN. Reach out to us on Discord if you want to learn more.

### Step 4: Connect Layer8 to Celebrity Fanalyzer and open source the AI ranking algorithm.
How do you determine what "better" when opinions are subjective? The simplest way would be to centralize the process. Of course, this would mean only a single perspective would be given precedence. To expand the judging to others and decentralize the model, a crowd sourcing solution is necessary and this is a hard problem. Once Layer8 is deployed, Celebrity Fanalyzer will have piles of anonymous data to analyze and to do this properly we need your help! Once established, an open source ranking algorithm will be employed to reward authors who contribute the ‚Äúbest‚Äù work via the DAPP protocols developed and deployed earlier. What is ‚Äúbest‚Äù? The answer is to-be-determined.

### Step 5: Relaunch Celebrity Fanalyzer as "Globe & Citizen," as a news aggregator.
Deep fakes, fake media, toxic hate speech, and centralized media industry driven by profit: this is the reality of the internet we live in. How to decentralize control of the media we consume but still provide a quality service on par with a centralized one? Once Layer 8 is established, the AI ranking algorithm is open sourced, and Celebrity Fanalyzer is a successful DAPP, it‚Äôs finally time to launch Globe & Citizen ‚Äî our answer to this question. Reach out to us if you‚Äôre interested in getting involved.
