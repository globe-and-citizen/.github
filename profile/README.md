# Welcome to Globe & Citizen

We are a fully remote company based out of Canada with members spread around the world.

Forget borders, feel free and feel safe to contribute because here at G&C, we pretend **Our World is One Country**. Disagree? Wherever you are, fork our repo and send us a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kBpdUbkNQU) and we'll hit you back with some cryptocurrency. There are no borders here!

Our objective is to become Web3's decentralized news service. 

## Development Roadmap

### Step 1: Develop a custom application to replace the WordPress blog.
Currently, Celebrity Fanalyzer is a very simple concept built on a very simple platform: WordPress. To gain more control over development, style, and function, a custom application is under development to replace the current version.

### Step 2: Build Layer 8.
Ultimately, our goal is to launch Celebrity Fanalyzer behind a custom built anonymizing reverse proxy scheduled for development in late 2023 that we call ‚ÄúLayer 8.‚Äù

### Step 3: Make it a DAPP
Celebrity Fanalyzer is one of many projects exploring how crypto currency can be used. Our goal is to make Celebrity Fanalyzer a DAPP (a Distributed APPlication) by connecting it to a blockchain. Anyone with a crypto wallet should be able to participate in our competitions, give their opinion, and get paid if they contribute meaningfully.

### Step 4: Connect Celebrity Fanalyzer to Layer 8
How to determine the definition of "better" when opinions are subjective by definition? The simplest way is to implement a centralized process but this, of course, means only a single perspective is represented. A decentralize model of "better" is necessary and this is a hard problem. Once Layer 8 is deployed, Celebrity Fanalyzer will have vast amounts of anonymous data to analyze freely. How to rank (and reward) authors who contribute the "best" work? The answer is to-be-determined. Give us your thoughts! Give us your feedback!

### Step 5: Launch Globe & Citizen
